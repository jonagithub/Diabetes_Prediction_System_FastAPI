# Diabetes_Prediction_System_FastAPI

- Deployed the diabetes prediction model using FastAPI in the 'ml_api.py’ file
  - Defined an API endpoint (‘/diabetes_prediction’) for making predictions
  - Checked the output through SwagerUI for API validation
- API validation through Python code defined in ‘api_implementation.py’
  - Python script acts as a client that sends input data to the server and receives the prediction
Screenshot of the output are FastAPIOutput.PNG and FastAPIOutput2.PNG
